## Details ##

### Sorting ###

Drag tiles from the game board to the **Sequence list area** in the correct order. Tiles with a speech bubble icon have a **description** which appears when you mouse over the tile.

### Submitting ###

When you've ordered the tiles to your liking click on the **Submit Sequence** button. This will show you how many items you have in the right sequence. You can continue submitting sequences until you receive a 100% score or run out of guesses. The remaining guess count is displayed under the **Try Again** button. You can always complete the widget early, which will give you a score based on your highest scoring submission.
